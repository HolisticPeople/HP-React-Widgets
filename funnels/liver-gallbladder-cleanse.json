      },
      {
        "question": "Can I eat normally during the cleanse?",

      {
        "question": "Are there any side effects?",

        "question": "Can I do this cleanse if I don't have a gallbladder?",

      },
      {
        "question": "How often can I repeat this cleanse?",
        "answer": "We recommend completing the full protocol 2-4 times per year, typically with the change of seasons. Between cleanses, you can continue with maintenance supplements like the Liver Gallbladder Tonic or Curcumin."

        "question": "Is this protocol safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?",
